## This app titled Simple Interest Calculator, will compute the interest one can earn given the amount you wish to save, the number of years you can keep it invested and the interest rate the bank would pay you.

### The application calculates the simple interest after the user enters the principle, interest rate and the duration in years. For example, if the user enters 1000000 as amount, 3.5 as rate of interest and 5 as No. of years, the following message is shown after the user clicks on the "Compute Interest" button.

## Example:
    If you deposit 1000000,
    at an interest rate of 3.5%.
    You will receive an amount of 175000,
    in the year 2025
